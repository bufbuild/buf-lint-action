# `buf-lint-action`

This [Action] enables you to [lint] Protobuf files with [Buf] in your GitHub Actions pipelines. If
it detects violations of your configured [lint rules][lint.rules], it automatically creates inline
comments under the rule-breaking lines in your `.proto` files.

![Per-line pull request comments](./static/img/lint.png)

## Usage

Here's an example usage of the `buf-lint` Action:

```yaml
on: pull_request # Apply to all pull requests
jobs:
  lint-protos:
    # Run `git checkout`
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # install the `buf` CLI
    - uses: bufbuild/buf-setup-action@v0.5.0
    # Run linting
    - uses: bufbuild/buf-lint-action@v1
```

With this configuration, the `buf` CLI runs the lint checks specified in your [`buf.yaml`][buf-yaml]
configuration file. If any violations are detected, `buf-lint-action`

## Prerequisites

For `buf-lint-action` to work. you need to install the `buf` CLI in the GitHub Actions Runner first.
We recommend using the [`buf-setup`][buf-setup] Action to install it (as in the example
[above](#usage)).

## Configuration

Parameter | Description | Default
:---------|:------------|:-------
`input` | The path of the [Input] you want to lint check | `.`
`buf_token` | The Buf [authentication token][token] used for private [Inputs][input] |

> These parameters are derived from [`action.yml`](./action.yml)

## Common tasks

### Run against Input in sub-directory

Some repositories are structured in such a way that their [`buf.yaml`][buf-yaml] is defined in a
sub-directory alongside their Protobuf sources, such as a proto/ directory. Here's an example:

```sh
$ tree
.
└── proto
    ├── acme
    │   └── weather
    │       └── v1
    │           └── weather.proto
    └── buf.yaml
```

In that case, you can target the `proto` sub-directory by setting `input` to `proto`:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: bufbuild/buf-setup-action@v0.5.0
  # Run lint only in the `proto` sub-directory
  - uses: bufbuild/buf-lint-action@v1
    with:
      input: proto
```
